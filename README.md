# CamProfiler

Goals
-   [ ] Apply cam curves with different functions
    -   [X] Straight line fit
    -   [X] Polynomial fit
    -   [ ] Sinusoidal fit
    -   [X] Apply function on cam curve
    -   [ ] Smart piece-wise?
-   [X] Circular convolution
-   [ ] Further modify cam curve
    -   [ ] Experiment with different kernels for smoothening
    -   [ ] Non-linear scaling
-   [X] Convert linear cam curve into geometric shape
-   [ ] Convert geometric shape into linear cam curve
    -   [ ] Detect edge and center
-   [ ] Calculate cam data (displacement, PVAJ, etc.)
    -   [ ] Discrete calculations
    -   [ ] Calculation from function
    -   [ ] Calculate volume of air flowed pass valve
-   [ ] Suggest changes to reduce acceleration and jerk
    -   [ ] Discontinuity alert
-   [X] Create 3D cam model 
-   [ ] Generate cam design with set parameters

To-do's:
-   [ ] Fix linting
-   [ ] Rewrite cam.py to use more existing numpy vectorized functions
